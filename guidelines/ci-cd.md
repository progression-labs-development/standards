## CI/CD & Deployment

Use the `progression-labs-development/github-actions` reusable workflows for all CI/CD.

### Requirements

- Use `progression-labs-development/github-actions` reusable actions for CI workflows (lint, test, build, standards checks)
- Deploy and publish workflows may use custom YAML but must follow OIDC patterns below
- OIDC authentication to both AWS and GCP (no static keys)
- Cross-account OIDC policies enable AWS ↔ GCP access where needed
- Branch-per-environment strategy (dev/stag/prod branches) for service repos

### What the Package Provides

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lint` | Run linting and standards checks |
| `test` | Run tests with coverage reporting |
| `build` | Build TypeScript/Python packages |
| `deploy` | Deploy via Pulumi with OIDC auth |
| `publish-npm` | Publish packages to npm registry |
| `docker-build` | Build and push Docker images |

### Standards Enforcement

All repos must use `@progression-labs-development/conform` to validate against Progression Labs standards:

```bash
pnpm add -D @progression-labs-development/conform
```

This is run automatically in CI via the `lint` action.

### Git & Branching Strategy

Branches mirror environments:

| Branch | Environment |
|--------|-------------|
| `dev` | Development — active work, may break |
| `stag` | Staging — pre-production, mirrors prod |
| `prod` | Production — what users see |

Set `dev` as the default branch in GitHub so PRs target it by default. Merging up (`dev → stag → prod`) promotes code through environments.

#### Prototype Phase

New projects start simple — just `main` branch, no extra branches, no ceremony. Ship fast. Graduate to the full `dev → stag → prod` flow once you have users.

### Backend Deployment

Backend services deploy to AWS/GCP via Pulumi through `progression-labs-development/github-actions`.

| Branch | URL | AWS Account |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| `dev` | dev.yourapp.com | Dev |
| `stag` | stag.yourapp.com | Stag |
| `prod` | yourapp.com | Prod |

Each branch auto-deploys to its matching environment with branch-specific environment variables pointing to the corresponding AWS account. Branch names match environment names match AWS accounts — no confusion.

### Frontend Deployment

Frontends deploy to Vercel. The same branch strategy applies:

- **Production branch:** `prod`
- **Preview branches:** `dev`, `stag`, feature branches
- Assign custom domains to each branch
- Set environment variables per branch (API URLs, feature flags)

### Repository to AWS OU Mapping

Each project repository maps to exactly one AWS Organizational Unit (OU). Each OU contains three accounts: dev, stag, and prod. This creates clear ownership, deployment boundaries, and cost attribution.

**Project repositories** deploy infrastructure or applications. Each project repo maps to one OU and deploys only to its three accounts.

**Shared packages** are libraries consumed by other repositories. They contain no deployable infrastructure and do not map to any OU.

#### Structure

```
/project-api        →  Workloads OU  (dev/stag/prod)
/project-frontend   →  Workloads OU  (dev/stag/prod)
/data               →  Data OU       (dev/stag/prod)
/shared-utils       →  No OU (library only)
```

#### Cross-OU Access

When resources in one OU need access to another (e.g., application accessing data platform), use explicit cross-account IAM roles. This ensures dependencies are intentional and auditable.

#### Benefits

- **Clear ownership:** one repo, one team, one OU
- **Simple CI/CD:** each repo deploys to exactly three accounts
- **Cost tracking:** OU-level billing maps to teams/projects
- **Security boundaries:** environment isolation by default

#### OU Mapping Anti-Patterns

- ❌ One repo deploying to multiple OUs
- ❌ Shared packages containing infrastructure
- ❌ Implicit cross-account access without explicit IAM

### Deployment Flow

```
dev → stag → prod
```

Merging up promotes code through environments. Each branch auto-deploys to its matching environment.

### Required Checks

All must pass before deploy:
- Lint
- Type check
- Tests
- Build
- Generated files up to date

### Rollback

- **Failed deploy:** Auto-rollback on failure
- **Bug in prod:** Revert the merge to prod or re-run previous successful deploy

### What NOT to Do

- Deploy from local machine
- Use long-lived AWS keys
- Write custom CI workflow YAML (use reusable actions for lint/test/build)
- Skip checks
- Push directly to prod (always go through dev → stag first)
